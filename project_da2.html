    <h3 class="major">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>We have performed a series of queries that have allowed us to better understand the data set and selected 4 of them that were set up as SQL Data Views.</p>
    <p>These views contain specific information for vizualizations and the information on these tables can be automatically refreshed once new data is loaded into SQL SERVER, as you can see on the previous project called <b>ETL project with Python Pandas</b>.</p>
    <h4>Views created in SQL Server</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Global numbers - World Covid-19 death toll</li>
      <li>Continent numbers - Covid-19 death toll by continent</li>
      <li>Total cases by country vs population - Countries summary of highest number of infected cases compared to population</li>
      <li>Infection rate by country vs population - Countries population infection rate by date</li>
    </ol>
    <p>At this point, we can either link our database or export our data in csv files to be imported into a data visualization tool.</p>

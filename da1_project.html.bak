          <h3>Business Request and User Stories </h3>
          <p>The business request for this project was to prepare a sales report
            for sales managers and sales representatives. Based on the
            request&nbsp; the necessary user stories were defined that must be
            followed to ensure the project delivery accordingly to the
            acceptance criteria that were set and maintained throughout the
            project. We have to ensure that the relevant KPI’s are present and
            that we have the relevant answer.</p>

          <h3>Data Cleansing and Transformation</h3>
          <p>The required information is on the AdventureWorks database (SQL
            SERVER) and to proceed with our business request and user stories we
            had to extract this information using T-SQL.</p>
          <p>An additional data source was required (sales budgets) in order to
            present one of our KPI's. This was supplied as an excel file and
            added to our model at a later point.</p>
          <p>We have selected the tables with the required information and
            proceed to select and clean the information we require. The Cleaning
            was done using AZURE DATA STUDIO within a notebook.</p>
          <span class="image fit"><img src="images/aw_3.jpg" alt=""></span>
          <p> Please see below the SQL statements used for cleansing and
            transforming the data exported from the notebook. </p>

          <h3>Data Model </h3>
          <p>Once the data was cleaned and transformed, it was exported to Excel
            files, which were subsequently loaded into Power BI.</p>
          <p> Once in Power BI, the data model was prepared and the tables were
            connected. We can also see how the sales budget mentioned earlier
            (FACT_Budget) connect with our data model. </p>
          <span class="image fit"><img src="images/aw_2.jpg" alt=""></span>
          <h3>Sales Management Dashboard </h3>
          <p>The dashboard is comprised of three pages.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Sales Overview</li>
            <li>Customer Details</li>
            <li>Products Details</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The Sales overview provides us with a general view where we can see
            our Sales vs Budget along with the best customers and most sold
            products. The other pages provide more details regarding customers
            and products. All the results can be filtered by year, month,
            customer city, product name, product category and subcategory.</p>
